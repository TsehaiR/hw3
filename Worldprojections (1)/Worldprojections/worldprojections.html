    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Displaying the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>QGIS allows the user to change the projection of a map by clicking the CRS button in the bottem right hand corner. From there, the user is able to search for different projections by typing the EPSG number into the "filter" search bar. After selecting the desired projection and clicking "OK" the map will appear in the proper projection on the main page. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The center portion of the map is the most accurate portion of the map while toward the poles there is a large amount of horizontal stretching. This map seems to prioritize size over shape as the landmass presented is generally accurately sized, but continents to the far north and south such as Greenland and Antarctica are far wider than would be accurate. </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The map depicts the size of continents well, but the edges of the map have some shape distortion as continents such as Australia suffer from some amount of vertical stretching. The map is curved slightly in order to mimic the Earthâ€™s shape and conserve the general area of the landmasses presented. </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Shape seems to be generally well conserved with this map compared to the others. As with the other maps, the accuracy is highest near the center and increases moving away from the center point. While the shapes of the continents are well preserved, size seems to be an issue.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkle 1 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map seems to strike a balance between size and shape distortion. There does seem to be some prioritization of size however, as a large portion of the area seems to have some vertical stretching even in the center where similar maps have limited shape distortion. Like the Aitoff projection this projection is also slightly curved. </h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map seems to depict the area at the North Pole most accurately and distortion increases moving away from this area. The area to the edges of the map are stretched horizontally and vertically, and there is a lot of shape and size distortion with many continents. Unlike other maps, this map is circular and seems to view the Earth from above the North Pole.
    </h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map seems to depict the area at the north pole most accurately and distortion increases moving away from this area. The area to the edges of the map are streched horizontally and vertically, and there is a lot of shape and size distortion with many continents.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">

    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is another map similar to the World Equidistant Conic Projection that displays the North Pole accurately at the expense of distorting continents like Antarctica which are far wider than accurate. Like the Conic Projection, this map also displays the Earth in a circular manner. 
    </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is able to present a large amount of the continents accurately in both shape and size. However there is a large amount of size distortion and vertical stretching toward the edges of the map. </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53032.png">

    <h2>Sphere van der Grinten l Projection</h2>
    <h3>Size distortion seems highest approaching the poles, while shape distortion seems greatest to the far east and west. </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53029.png">
    <img src=".//maps/53029.png" alt="Sphere van der grinten l" width='500px'>

    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, 53032, 53029</h3>
